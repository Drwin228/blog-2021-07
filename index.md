Welcome to Dr. Nguyen's Class

I have been teaching at Saint Paul Technical and Community College for almost 40 years, I am a strong advocate for technology equity and opportunity for all students to achieve their education. I have served in different capacities both non-profit and governmental agencies related to educational policy. I received the Lieutenant Governor's Award for Community Service and I  received the Pioneer Partner Leadership Award for Innovator in Educational Technology from The Great Lakes Governors Council. In 1999 I was selected as a finalist for the Leaders in Learning, Cable Industry Leadership Award.
I would like to welcome you to this math class.  Whatever your past experiences, either you have taken an online class on never take one before. I encourage you to look at this mathematics course as an opportunity to make you a better student. I want you to get a good start by building great momentum from the first day of class. Try to take a proactive role in this course with a positive attitude about mathematics. I believe if you work hard you will be successful and this math course will help you to build a foundation for a more advanced math course that you may need for your major. As we all are going through this unprecedented time we need to look out for one another and support each other and I hope you find your learning experience here at the college a successful one.
All the best and happy learning!!

Dr. Francois Nguyen
